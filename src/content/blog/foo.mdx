Frontmatter is placed at the top of the MDX file between sets of three hyphens (---). Each frontmatter field should be placed on its own line. Example:
```md
---
title: title (required)
description: description (required)
date: MM-DD-YYYY (required)
image: "/blog/foo/bar.png" (optional)
---
```

Images should be placed in the `public` folder, and the path should always be relative and starts with a `/`, i.e, `/blog/<slug>/*.png`
